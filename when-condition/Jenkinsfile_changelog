//changelog gets a regular expression and matches it with the message of the last git commit. 
//If the log message is matched to the given pattern, the following stage gets executed. 
//You should note that this condition works only in Multibranch pipelines and those Pipelines that the script is from the SCM repo. 
//In the below example, the stage is run when the git commit message contains “Test” string.
